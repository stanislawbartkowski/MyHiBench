HiBench, like any other benchmark, can be used to measure the performance of the Hadoop setup and also as a tool to evaluate the general health check of the installation because it touches and streches many aspects of Hadoop stack.<br>
Although the configuration of HiBench is simple and straighforward, at the beginning is not obvious and requires several lessons to be learnt.
